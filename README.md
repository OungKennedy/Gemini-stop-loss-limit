# Poloniex-stop-loss-limit
Currently the cryptocurrency trading website Gemini.com lacks a stop loss order. 
This bot works off an API wrapper by mattselph to input stop loss orders.
The API wrapper can be found here:https://github.com/mattselph/gemini-python-unoffc
The can be tested in a sandbox environment on Gemini.com
Further instructions can be found in the python file itself.
PLease leave a comment in the issues tab if there are any changes you'd like to see.
